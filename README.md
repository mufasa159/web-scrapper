## Web Scrapper

A tiny python program to scrap informations from websites. The file `main.py` scraps title, link and author's name from each post of [The NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology)' technology section, and saves it in `posts.csv` file.


### Installation

Make sure you have python installed on your machine. If not, go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), download the latest version and install it on your device.  

Open terminal, and `cd` to the project directory. Then run the following commands.  
`pip3 install bs4`  
`pip3 install requests`  

Now you may modify the code however you like.  
Use command `python3 main.py` to run the code.  

For better view, open the `posts.csv` file using Microsoft Excel or Numbers (on mac) application.
